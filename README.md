# SLAM-in-ROS

build maps with the slam_gmapping node from the gmapping package. The slam_gmapping node uses an implementation of the GMapping algorithm. GMapping uses a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter to keep track of the likely positions of the robot, based on its sensor data and the parts of the map that have already been built.

Code is explained in my blog: https://arpan12.github.io/RoboticsBlog/posts/SLAM%20in%20ROS/
